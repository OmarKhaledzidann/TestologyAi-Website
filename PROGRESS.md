# Testology — Implementation Progress

## Completed

### Step 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize TanStack Start project (React 19 + Vite 7)
- [x] Install Bun as package manager
- [x] Configure TanStack Router (file-based routing)
- [x] Install & configure Tailwind CSS v4 with Testology brand colors
- [x] Initialize shadcn/ui (auto-detected TanStack Start + Tailwind v4)
- [x] Install canvas-confetti + types
- [x] Copy Za'atar assets (favicon-logo.png, halfRobot.png, robot.png) to `/public/`
- [x] Configure SSG prerendering in `vite.config.ts`
- [x] Verify dev server starts on port 3000

### Step 2: Static Data & Types
- [x] Create TypeScript types (`src/types.ts`): Certificate, Chapter, Question, Option
- [x] Create seed JSON data — 3 certificates (AWS CCP, Azure AZ-900, CompTIA A+), each with "All Chapters" + 2 chapters, 5 questions each
  - `src/data/certificates.json`
  - `src/data/chapters/aws-cloud-practitioner.json`
  - `src/data/chapters/azure-fundamentals.json`
  - `src/data/chapters/comptia-a-plus.json`
- [x] Create data utility functions (`src/utils/data.ts`): getCertificates, getCertificateById, getChapters, getChapterById
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly

### Step 3: Layout, SEO & Landing Page
- [x] Create root layout (`src/routes/__root.tsx`) with navbar (Za'atar favicon-logo.png as logo, nav links, exam timer slot in top-right)
- [x] Configure per-route `<title>`, meta descriptions, OpenGraph tags (use `favicon-logo.png` as `og:image`)
- [x] Set up sitemap generation at build time (custom Vite plugin in `vite.config.ts`)
- [x] Build landing page (`src/routes/index.tsx`) with hero section featuring Za'atar (halfRobot.png) and CTA button → `/certificates`
- [x] Add global error boundary with Za'atar illustration (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- [x] Remove starter template `about.tsx`
- [x] Update Header, Footer, ThemeToggle with Testology branding
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly

---

### Step 4: Certificates Page
- [x] Build responsive card grid (1 col mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop)
- [x] Each card: logo/icon (lucide Award), title, description, chapter count, "Let's Start" button
- [x] "Let's Start" navigates to `/certificates/$certId`
- [x] Updated Header and landing page CTAs to type-safe `<Link>` for `/certificates`
- [x] SEO: per-route title, description, OpenGraph tags
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly

---

### Step 5: Chapters Page
- [x] Display certificate info + chapter list with back-link to certificates
- [x] "All Chapters" card at top with Practice & Exam buttons
- [x] Individual chapter cards with title, question count, Practice & Exam buttons
- [x] Route loader with `notFound()` for invalid certId + not-found component with Za'atar
- [x] SEO: per-route title, description, OpenGraph tags
- [x] Updated CertificateCard "Let's Start" to type-safe `<Link>`
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly

---

### Step 6: Practice Mode
- [x] All questions on a single scrollable page, no timer
- [x] Instant feedback on answer selection (green checkmark / red X + explanation)
- [x] Submit button at bottom → stores answers in localStorage, navigates to results (`?mode=practice`)
- [x] Submit disabled until all questions answered (shows progress count)
- [x] Route loader with `notFound()` for invalid certId/chapterId
- [x] Updated ChapterCard practice link to type-safe `<Link>`
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly

---

### Step 7: Exam Mode
- [x] All questions on a single scrollable page
- [x] 60-minute countdown timer in navbar top-right (portal into `#exam-timer-slot`)
- [x] No feedback until submit (ExamQuestionCard shows selection only)
- [x] Question & answer choice shuffling on new attempts
- [x] localStorage persistence for answers + timer (keyed by certId + chapterId + mode)
- [x] Resume/restart prompt when returning with existing saved data
- [x] Submit button → review modal (answered/unanswered count, "Go Back" / "Confirm Submit")
- [x] Auto-submit on timer expiry ("Time's up!" modal, 3s, then navigate to results)
- [x] Loading spinner while questions initialize
- [x] Updated ChapterCard exam link to type-safe `<Link>`
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly

---

### Step 8: Exit Confirmation
- [x] `beforeunload` handler for browser close/refresh (via `enableBeforeUnload` in useBlocker)
- [x] TanStack Router navigation blocker for in-app navigation (`useBlocker` with `withResolver`)
- [x] Confirmation modal: "Are you sure you want to leave? Your progress will be lost."
- [x] On confirm ("Leave"), clears exam localStorage data then proceeds with navigation
- [x] Hook: `src/hooks/useExitConfirmation.ts`, modal inline in exam page (no separate component needed)
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly

---

### Step 9: Results Page
- [x] Shared results route with `?mode=exam|practice` query parameter
- [x] Redirect to chapters page if no data in localStorage
- [x] **Exam results** (`?mode=exam`):
  - Score: X/N and percentage
  - Pass threshold: 80%
  - Pass → "Congratulations!" + Za'atar (halfRobot.png) + canvas-confetti
  - Fail → "Keep practicing!" + Za'atar encouragement
  - Wrong answers review (user's answer in red/X, correct in green/checkmark)
  - "Try Again" button (clears localStorage, navigates to exam)
  - "Back to Chapters" button
- [x] **Practice results** (`?mode=practice`):
  - Score summary only (no pass/fail, no confetti, no wrong answers review)
  - "Practice Again" button
  - "Back to Chapters" button
- [x] Files: `src/routes/certificates/$certId/chapters/$chapterId/results.tsx`, `src/components/ResultsSummary.tsx`, `src/components/WrongAnswerReview.tsx`
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly

---

## Remaining

### Step 10: Polish & Responsiveness
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness across all pages
- [ ] Accessibility: keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA live regions, icon+text feedback (not color alone)
- [ ] Verify localStorage behavior (cleanup on new attempt, resume prompt)
- [ ] Test all navigation guards (in-app + beforeunload)
- [ ] Verify SEO: unique titles, meta tags, sitemap, OpenGraph
- [ ] 404 / invalid route handling → redirect to `/certificates`
- [ ] Empty states with Za'atar illustration
- [ ] Error boundary with Za'atar illustration

## Key Architecture Notes

- **Package**: `@tanstack/react-start` (not deprecated `@tanstack/start`)
- **Tailwind v4**: Uses CSS `@theme` directive, not `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Brand colors**: Available as `bg-testology-navy`, `text-testology-blue`, etc. AND shadcn semantic tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-destructive`, etc.)
- **Path alias**: `#/` maps to `src/` (e.g., `import { getCertificates } from '#/utils/data'`)
- **SSG**: Configured via `prerender` option in `tanstackStart()` Vite plugin
- **"All Chapters"**: Has its own curated question set — NOT an aggregation of other chapters
- **Bun**: Run commands with `bun --bun run dev`, install with `bun add`
